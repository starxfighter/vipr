	This project was envisioned to solve an issue that the Veteran Affairs office has with not being able to answer the questions of veterans in a timely and efficient manner.
	
	VIPR is a veteran information portal, remote where veteran’s can voice their questions, concerns or requests for information and then have a single person answer the question for the veteran.
	
	This project is based on a RFP from the Veteran’s Affairs Department back in 2016.

	
Benefits

	Veteran has a single place to go to ask questions, concerns or information requests

	Requests are answered by help desk personnel that will research the request/issue and respond promptly without having the veteran go to or call multiple places to get an answer
